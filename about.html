            A hulking 1964 building on the busy intersection of Wilshire
            Boulevard and Normandie Avenue took the city by storm when it
            reopened after a renovation by the Sydell Group (NoMad Hotel, Ace
            Hotel). The grid-like facade is organized into perfectly square
            windows back-lined with neon colored curtains, which quickly became
            the selling point for the hotel’s 388 rooms.

          <p>
            Designed by Sean Knibb—he of the hipster flower cafe in Venice—all
            the rooms offer views of either Wilshire Boulevard or the Hollywood
            Hills. The latter are slightly more expensive, for obvious reasons.
            But to have unfettered sight lines of the Griffith Observatory and
            the Hollywood Sign while bingeing Netflix, all cozy in your
            art-filled, concrete-walled sanctuary is certainly a treat. A whole
            lot of love was also heaped upon the dining operation, and with good
            reason: from the international newsstand shop, Poketo, to Commissary
            (an all-day dining spot whose greenhouse-like design makes you feel
            like you’re eating in a Victorian palace), the lobby has
            sufficiently diverse attractions to keep an interesting mix of
            Koreatown locals and far-flung travelers coming through the doors.

            Tami: “The design was super chic and contemporary. I really liked
            the look of the place. Very artsy and quite different from other
            boutique hotels I've stayed at. They also had the Alfred coffee shop
            downstairs, which I loved. The restaurants and night entertainment
            were top notch.”

            Rebecca : “LA hipster hotel with great eating options, good service.
            Rooms were well designed to make the most of small urban spaces, and
            the decor was quirky and unique.”
